# vterm

This holds `vterm` packaged using a Nix Flake. 
The build is influenced by the [homebrew build](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/b68164c46c120917a8554bc1036a32c54d063462/Formula/lib/libvterm.rb) of `vterm`. 

The package is intended for use on Darwin (MacOS) systems only as another `vterm` package exists for Linux.
